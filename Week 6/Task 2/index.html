    <h4>Selectors</h4>
    <span>In CSS, selectors are used to target the HTML elements on our web pages that we want to style. There are a
        wide
        variety of CSS selectors available, allowing for fine-grained precision when selecting elements to style. In
        this article and its sub-articles we'll run through the different types in great detail, seeing how they work.

        <p>Dogs can have many positive effects on the lives of their owners. They influence social,
            emotional, and cognitive development in children, promote an active lifestyle, provide companionship, and
            have even been able to detect oncoming epileptic seizures or the presence of certain cancers. Dogs can also
            help to relieve stress and anxiety in people.Around 38% of US households are estimated to have one or more
            dogs. Although dogs can be beneficial to the health and wellbeing of their owners, people should be aware
            that dogs of any age, including puppies, can sometimes carry harmful germs that can make people sick.

        <h2>--- Cat ---</h2>
        <img src="./cat.jpg" height="200" width="200" />
        <p>Having a cat can mean different things to different people. Some want a cat to cuddle and sit on their laps;
            others are happy to live with a very independent cat which spends most of its time outside and doesn't want
            too much human interaction. What is important is that you try to find a cat that will interact with you if
            you want it to. All cats are not the same and how each individual cat behaves with you can depend on its
            inherent personality and early experiences (or lack of experiences), which can make it fearful or confident
            with people and life in general. The environment in which you keep a cat is also extremely significant

        <img src="./fish.jpg" height="200" width="200" />
        <p>Fish are ideal pets for people who don't have a lot of time or space for other common pets. Choosing and
            decorating aquariums for fish can also brighten up a home and be enjoyable for the whole family. Watching
            fish in an aquarium has been linked to improving stress. Pet fish come in many shapes, sizes, and colors so
            you'll need to consider what type of fish you're ready for: When considering what type of fish you want,
            you'll need to do some research on what will best fit into your lifestyle. Taking care of fish doesn't have
            to be a big commitment. In general, owning a pet has been linked to positive health benefits. Betta fish and
            common goldfish are most popular types of fish.</p>
